# 🏦 Bank Loan Risk Analysis (SQL + Python + Power BI)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes loan approval and default risk using SQL Server, Python (pandas), and Power BI.
It simulates a real-world bank loan dataset to identify approval trends, risk factors, and customer insights.

---

## 🧩 Tools Used
- **SQL Server Express** – Data cleaning and aggregation
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** – Data processing, KPIs, and visualization
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and storytelling
- **Excel** – Data validation and CSV creation

---

## 🧠 Key Business Questions
1. What is the overall loan approval and default rate?
2. Which education or property areas have a higher risk?
3. How does income relate to loan default probability?
4. Which demographic segments (gender/married) show better repayment behavior?
5. What loan sizes are most common or risky?

---

## 📊 Insights Summary
- Approval rate: **73%**  
- Default rate: **8.4% of approved loans**  
- Graduates default **40% less** than non-graduates  
- Urban customers show the highest approval & the lowest default  
- Most loans fall between **100K–150K PKR**
